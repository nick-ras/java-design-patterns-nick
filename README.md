# Java Design Patterns

This repository contains implementations of various design patterns in Java. Each design pattern is implemented in its own branch or directory with examples and explanations of its usage.

## Design Patterns Implemented

- **[MVC](MVC)**  
  The Model-View-Controller pattern, separating data, user interface, and control logic.

- **[Abstract Factory](abstract-factory)**  
  A pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

- **[Adapter](adapter)**  
  A pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together by converting one interface to another.

- **[Builder](builder)**  
  A pattern that allows constructing a complex object step by step.

- **[Prototype](prototype)**  
  A pattern that creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.

## Technologies Used

- Java 8 or higher
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
